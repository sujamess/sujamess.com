    <p>I'm James — a software engineer at <strong>Agoda</strong> who codes when I'm on fire, and games when I’m not.</p>

    <p>I enjoy building backend systems that are clean, resilient, and kind of overengineered (in a good way). I tend to dive deep into distributed systems, infrastructure, and low-level optimization — but only when the spark hits.</p>

    <p>When that fire’s out, you’ll find me gaming — usually FPS, sometimes strategy.</p>

    <p><em>That’s the loop:</em><br>
    <strong>Code hard when inspired. Game harder when not.</strong></p>
